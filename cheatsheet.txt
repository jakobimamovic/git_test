Commands related to a remote repository:
    git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

Commands related to the workflow:
    git add .
    git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
    git status
    git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

    git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    git status is read as git | status | (no destination).

Starting a new repository:
    1. Make a new repository on github and add a README file
    2. Connect the repository with the help of SSH key and clone/copy the repository onto your local machine
    NOTE: You MUST click the SSH option to get the correct URL.
    3. mkdir <name of your directory that will contain your repository>
    4. Move to the folder via terminal
    5. terminal Commands:
        - git clone <copied link from github>
        - check if it's working with git remote -v
USE THE GIT WORKFLOW:
    touch <name.extension> --> creates a new file with the extension that you want
    git status --> checks what's happening with your files at that time
    git add <name.extension> --> moves the file into staging area
    git commit -m --> commits the file that was in staging area and creates a snapshot of it
    git push origin main / git push --> uploads the commitments onto github
    git log --> checks what's been happening to the files
